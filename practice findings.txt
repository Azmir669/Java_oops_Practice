What is an Anonymous Object in Java?
An anonymous object is an object that doesn’t have a reference variable.

You create it and use it immediately, but you don’t store it for reuse.

Real-Life Analogy
Imagine a delivery person comes to your house. You open the door, take the package, and close it.
You didn’t ask for the person’s name, phone, or anything — just used their service once and moved on.

That’s an anonymous interaction — just like an anonymous object.

Limitations
You can’t reuse anonymous objects.

You can’t assign them to another variable later.

Not suitable when you need to perform multiple operations on the object.
